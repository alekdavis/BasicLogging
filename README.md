# BasicLogging.NET
BasicLogging.NET is a simple .NET wrapper that makes it a bit easier to add logging to your application. Currently, it is built on top of the popular [log4net](https://logging.apache.org/log4net/) framework, but it can be extended to support other frameworks, such as [NLog](http://nlog-project.org/).
